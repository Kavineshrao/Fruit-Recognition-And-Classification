# Fruit-Recognition-And-Classification
This is one of my course (Distributed And Parallel Computing) final project. I finished the project partially just to finish my semester. This project uses OpenCV (computer vision), Python and Haar Cascade. I just get to run the code for a fruit (banana) detection and able to classify it using the grade value.
